## 🚨 Forking this repo

Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own websites. The answer to that question is _usually_ "yes", with attribution. There are some cases, such as using this code for a business or something that is greater than a personal project, that I may be less comfortable saying yes to. If in doubt, please don't hesitate to ask me.

I value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. I spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing, designing, and trying to perfect this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask is to not claim this effort as your own.
you may [email](mailto:nevilparmar24@gmail.com) me if you are not sure what to do, Thanks ..!!
